This is the first commit of the my-app demonstration code to exercise the
Afero stack on a linux system built with Yocto.

This repo includes the application, the APE profile project you will need to
create the profile that you will use with this system and the meta-app recipes
to build the app.

Instructions on how to utilize this repo is dependent on whether you are using
a Beagle Bone Green Wireless, which is afero's reference platform,
or the sama5d2.

The instructions are on developer.afero.com under the linux sdk potenco setup
guides.
